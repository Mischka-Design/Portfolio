          <h2>Opportunity</h2>
          <p>Both UX and UI audit were essential to launch the new company website for Go4IT Africa, I was assigned to create an engaging digital experience, improve lead capture and allow the new customers to understand and easily inquire about services we offer in a simple and intuitive way. 
            I led efforts to evolve the services and address customer pain points related to the browse and discovery experience.

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I met up with our CEO James Elstob to uncover insights and translate concepts into features that address customer behaviours and motivations.
            I promoted brainstormed some design and User Experience ideas to him to share the vision and this helped to evangelise ideas, gain alignment and drive decision making. I expressed customer goals and balanced business goals. 
            I prioritised and negotiated features for launch and beyond. Since our current Covid-19 situation, sales have declined noticeably if not completely vanished and now a sizable proportion of the travel industry’s revenue is made up by digital streaming and planning for the future, this helped us to be more confident in our solution and what we can offer the travel industry and helped drive motivation for the design of the interface. 
            Our challenge was to evolve with customers and enter the highly competitive digital travel world with a unique impact. In favour of speed to market, we were tasked to design and build our Go4IT Africa company website on our own platform solution using our client-based site architecture which at the time was still in development. 
            
            This tactic was perceived to be advantageous and the least risky. Each feature phase of the project was serialised, starting with the design and development through our provided resources. Once each feature was designed and approved, we were able to complete the build and run SEO tests to improve website speed and ranking. 
            
            The biggest challenge I faced throughout this project was balancing moving forward with designs, providing a unique user experience that stands out from the other online travel technology companies, and making a big impact in the digital world all while still moving forward with day-to-day business tasks as usual. This was hard. 
            
            Design principles and the content prioritisation framework helped to create visibility into my decision-making process and galvanise the team to share in the vision.
            My aims were to understand how clients thought about different categories of content and what was most important to them in the context of getting their brand out there and the advantageous of taking direct online bookings through their own payment gateways. During this thought process, I concluded that participants ranked content based on what they felt was predictable and what they could trust as relevant, what made them curious and finally what they were sceptical about. 
            I focused on giving users an effective and simplified experience by making the website easily navigable and attractive. Great visual design impacts user experience by capturing and holding attention, while also providing a professional, trustworthy aesthetic. Below is an example of a site map created for Go4IT Africa during the early stages of development.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The Homepage was designed to allow users quick access to the primary services of the web application.
            The order of the products and category pages was chosen to provide a way for the design to allow for future changes. Primarily designed to support people with a thirst for creativity. Aspirational imagery is used on the homepage to carry out the message that we can change to fit any brand in the industry. In doing this, I hoped to amplify the positive aspects of showcasing a unique brand and to help users focus on what sets them apart from others.
            I wanted to create a sense of reassurance and let users know that they are in good hands. The interface design strives to be confident. It does not contain UI-bling or unnecessary elements. I opted for clear, readable typography – choosing colours with high contrast. The design is uncluttered, clean and well-spaced.
