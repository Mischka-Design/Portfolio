          <h2>Oppertunity</h2>
          <p>I joined Go4IT Africa in early January 2020 we still went by the name of Getlocal Solutions. There were only 5 of us who worked in the company at the time.
            The entire team was bundled up in one room in a shared office, our teaspoons went missing, one of our
            colleague’s cars got stolen and every moment defined the meaning of scrappy. But we were passionate.
            Our brand had a logo, a brilliant idea of a mission and a great solution for travel agencies through our
            super CMS.</br> During the pandemic, the travel and tourism in South Africa rapidly went downhill and the
            company chose to focus on selling white-label eCommerce websites to smaller travel agencies, so all of
            the success or failure of our business rested on creating strong websites that could convert to sales all
            whilst helping out start-up agencies.</br>
            I joined Go4IT right before the pandemic came into action and was forced to work from home during
            the first hard lockdown we faced. It was during this time I was assigned the task of designing a website
            for Dream Wild Adventures and to start taking on my role as a UX/UI designer at Go4IT Africa. I designed
            my first site (and learned myself how to code) by reverse-engineering sites I admired. I spent a lot of
            time doing online courses, attending webinars, reading blogs and other articles and practising on free
            source-code editors such as Notebook++ and VS Code.</p>

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge I faced during this project was believing in myself and learning my unique process
            of research, design and evaluation. It was very hard at first to train myself into taking on the mindset of
            the users and understanding their needs as well as the correct approach. My goal for this project was to
            capture the magic of Dream Wild Adventures. My ambitions were to create a strong foundation that
            embraced a rapidly evolving business and a more diverse user base.
          </p>
          <p>My goals were to,</p>
          <img src="#" alt="goals">
          <p>At the outset of this project I didn’t have a clear mission or specific goals for the Interface of this project.
            Without pre-existing insights, I partnered with Karen Gouvelis a female software developer with
            experience in contracting work at Go4IT Africa to explore how to get around on the platform we use to
            create the eCommerce websites as well as mentor me on some coding skills.
            Before I could jump into designing, it was important to define success and understand the CMS platform
            at scale. I unpacked the concept of the perfect booking experience for the dimensions of time, navigation
            and seamless flow. Based on these insights, I proposed two key feature ideas – The type of experience and
            the simplicity of the process to better understand where to easily book an experience. I feared that the
            first site experience would cause issues so I had to thought of a solution to re-assure myself.
            In order to de-risk some of my assumptions, I travelled to Makalali, Limpopo to meet with our clients and
            get a better sense of the company and what they offer their users, as well as show them the progress.</p>
            <div class="clientRel">
              <img src="#" alt="client and I">
              <p>To my surprise, they had no issues with the experience
                of the flow and were excited to learn about the
                platform and managing their website after the launch. I
                designed the site based on the idea of the location of
                the company, in the middle of the bushveld.
                Instead of designing for the perfect UX/UI experience, I
                designed a site custom to its character and friendly to
                its users.</p>

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            The design of the Dream Wild Adventure website has had a positive impact on the book and pay online
experience. The CMS and inventory have been handed over to the client to be managed and changed in the
future according to their liking. The Dream Wild team continued to evolve and polish the visual, as well as
the finer functional details to the products. Although I may not be as involved in the growth of the site
moving forward, it is great to see the foundation of my work brought to life. </p>
