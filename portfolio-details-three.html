          <h2>Opportunity</h2>
          <p>At Go4IT Africa we were tasked with designing and building a user-friendly website for Private Kruger
            Safaris, they were newbies to the digital world and urgently needed to drive traffic to their website so
            that when the travel ban has been lifted they will be flooded with bookings sales to regain the revenue
            they lost during the pandemic. Private Kruger Safaris started building a website through another
            company specializing in inventory but based on content and UX/UI audits of the website, we
            hypothesized that users were not aware of what the company offers exactly, the website was still at a
            very early age of development and needed some attention, so they contacted us.
            Private Kruger Safaris also has a sister company called B1 Photo Safaris where they take clients on
            photographic safaris in the Kruger National Park. The company has the most extraordinary photographs
            they took throughout their journeys in the Kruger National Park, these images enabled us to build a big
            part of the company character into the website.
            The biggest challenge we were going to face was having to merge two companies into one platform.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-description">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Our client approached us with two primary objectives – to enhance sales and usability online; and to
promote a more professional experience to their company beyond their competitors. Although our brief
was to promote better functionality than our client’s competitors, this was quite challenging because
we’ve been creating eCommerce platforms specializing in selling tours and experiences online almost
everyday, so achieving the goal of letting them stand out took some brainstorming.
To differentiate them in an already mature and competitive market, we needed to define a desirable role
for the website and how it would meet the needs of the users. We were thrilled by the opportunity to
create something more meaningful in a sense of this being two companies merged into one platform. I
opted for a lean approach on the UI side which emphasised sketching, exploring, client feedback, user
feedback (from my every helpful team at Go4IT) and mock-ups, this sparked tons of great ideas. gathering
as much research as possible about my client helped me develop a clear vision of the tonal expectations
of the users.
To communicate the personality of the website to our client, we developed a set of experience principles.
These were used to perceive design decisions, clearly express core values and describe key attributes the
site should uphold for both users and the company. These principles were used to constantly drive the
direction of the site.</p>
<img src="assets/img/portfolio/private-kruger-principles.png">
<p>I took a top-down approach (breaking up the big problem into smaller understandable chunks) to
  defining the overall structure of the experience. By wireframing and storyboarding, I generated stacks of
  ideas about the arrangement of UI, functional and data elements, and interactive behaviours. Starting
  broad, my vision began evolving into something concrete. The design language, interactions and the
  anatomy of the site began to piece together.</p>

  <img src="./assets/img/portfolio/pks-wireframe-2.png">
  </div>
  <p>I storyboarded my ideas to help design and communicate more complex interactions and flows. This was
    a huge time-saver.</p><img src="assets/img/portfolio/"

          <h2>Solution</h2>

           
          <p>
            The design of the Dream Wild Adventure website has had a positive impact on the book and pay online
experience. The CMS and inventory have been handed over to the client to be managed and changed in the
future according to their liking. The Dream Wild team continued to evolve and polish the visual, as well as
the finer functional details to the products. Although I may not be as involved in the growth of the site
moving forward, it is great to see the foundation of my work brought to life. </p>
